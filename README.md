# Pixel 10 Pro Thermal Polling Fix (Android 16)

A surgical Magisk/KernelSU module to correct a 5-minute thermal polling delay found in the initial Android 16 QPR builds for the Pixel 10 Pro.

## 🚨 The Issue
In the stock Android 16 firmware for the Pixel 10 Pro, the `PollingDelay` for critical thermal sensors is incorrectly set to **300,000ms** (5 minutes). 

This creates a massive "blind spot" in the system's thermal management. During heavy workloads, the CPU can hit 90°C+ before the Thermal HAL even attempts to sample the temperature, leading to heat soak and potential long-term battery degradation.

## ✅ The Fix
This module overlays the stock thermal configs with focused edits:
1.  **Reduces Polling Delay:** Sets `PollingDelay` to **5,000ms** for the `VIRTUAL-SKIN*` sensors across `thermal_info_config.json`, `thermal_info_config_throttling.json`, and `thermal_info_config_charge.json`.
2.  **Keeps OEM thresholds:** Restores the original `HotThreshold`, `CdevCeilingFrequency`, and `Profile` data so only the sampling cadence changes.
3.  **Retains Hysteresis & Passive Delay:** Keeps the default `PassiveDelay` (7,000ms) and `HotHysteresis` values to avoid oscillating CPU-frequency decisions even as the sensor updates faster.

## 📋 Technical Evidence & Root Cause
**Affected Component:** `/vendor/etc/thermal_info_config.json`  
**Target Config:** `VIRTUAL-SKIN-CPU-LIGHT-ODPM`

The stock configuration effectively disables real-time thermal management for burst workloads. By the time the 300s timer expires, the device has already reached thermal saturation. This module restores the expected behavior for a flagship Tensor G5 device.

## ✅ Additional Overlays
* `/vendor/etc/thermal_info_config_throttling.json` and `thermal_info_config_charge.json` inherit the same 5s polling cadence so the HAL cannot revert to the 300s delay through the included files.

### Verification
Run the following command in Termux (with root) to verify the fix is active:
```bash
cat /vendor/etc/thermal_info_config.json | grep -A 15 "VIRTUAL-SKIN-CPU-LIGHT-ODPM"
# Ensure "PollingDelay" is now 5000.
```
Verify the included files as well:
```bash
cat /vendor/etc/thermal_info_config_throttling.json | rg -n "VIRTUAL-SKIN-CPU-LIGHT-ODPM" -C2
cat /vendor/etc/thermal_info_config_charge.json | rg -n "PollingDelay" -C1
```

🛠 Installation
 * Download the thermal_fix.zip from the Releases tab.
 * Install via Magisk Manager or KernelSU.
 * Reboot your device.
